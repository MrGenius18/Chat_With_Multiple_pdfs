# Chat_With_Multiple_pdfs
 This project allows users to upload multiple PDF files and interact with their content using a chat-based interface. It leverages LangChain, FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), and Streamlit to extract text, store embeddings, and generate responses based on user queries.
